oc v3.3 — MCP Automation Engine Package
=========================================
Provides thread-safe, deterministic automation tools for the oc security
research agent. Each module is independently invokable both as a CLI script
and as an importable Python library.

Modules:
  oast_manager    — OAST blind vulnerability callback polling
  dom_analyzer    — Structural DOM differential analyzer
  saliency_filter — Recon output saliency pre-processor
  payload_mutator — Deterministic seed-mutation engine

All modules resolve paths relative to the repository root (~/agents/oc/)
regardless of the current working directory.
